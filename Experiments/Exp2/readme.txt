ubbi: Uniaxial Bergstrom Boyce (Incompressible)

Data from goktepe+miehe05 paper Fig7b fitted on modified bergstrom boyce

Data:
    Experimental data from paper
    Fig 7b
    Data made sparser by taking every fifth point

Fitting:
    No parameters fixed, aj to the power of 4
    Evaluated on the same data, plot in results for P11 vs stretch and true strain vs true stress

Comments:
    The next steps should be to check the fit on the other viscous data
    Also to see how the increase in terms helps the fit
    You should make animations
