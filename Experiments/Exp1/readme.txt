ubbi: Uniaxial Bergstrom Boyce (Incompressible)

Data from dal+kaliske paper fitted on same model

Data:
    Synthetic data generated using ubbi parameters from dal+kaliske09 paper
    Two sets of compression mdata with true strain rates -0.002/s and -0.1/s
        with relaxation of 120 s at true strain = 0.3 and 0.6
    Used large dt_relaxation and dt_linear to make data sparse

Fitting:
    Fitted to ubbi perfectly
