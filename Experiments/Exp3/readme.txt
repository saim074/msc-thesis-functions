ubbi: Uniaxial Bergstrom Boyce (Incompressible)

Data from goktepe+miehe05 paper Fig7c and 7d fitted on modified bergstrom boyce

Data:
    Experimental data from paper
    Fig 7c (visco3_2) rate = 0.5/min and d(visco2_2) rate=5/min
    Data made sparser by taking every fifth point

Fitting:
    No parameters fixed, aj to the power of 4
    Evaluated on the same data, plot in results for P11 vs stretch and true strain vs true stress

Comments:
    So it seems that the highest nonlinearity comes from Fig7d where the rate is highest
    Also to see how the increase in terms helps the fit data from 7d
    You should make animations
