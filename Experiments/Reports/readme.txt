ubbmi: Uniaxial bergstrom boyce modified (incompressible)

- Report 1
    Shows the fit of ubbmi to Figures 7b, c, d (miehe+goktepe05) from Experiment 3
    Shows how increase of coefficients doesn't help fit for Fig 7d (fastest experiemnt)

- Report 2
    Shows that fitting to Fig 7b and d (Fastest and slowest) isn't good and doesn't generalize
    to other datasets Fig 7d, 8 and 9
